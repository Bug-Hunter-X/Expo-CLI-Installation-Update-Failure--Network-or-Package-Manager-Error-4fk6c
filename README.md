This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Expo CLI: installation or update failures caused by network problems, corrupted cache, or package manager misconfigurations.  The `expoBug.js` file shows a scenario where the error might occur (simulated), and the `expoBugSolution.js` file illustrates how to troubleshoot and resolve these problems.

## Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Check Network Connectivity:** Ensure you have a stable internet connection.
2. **Clear Expo and npm/yarn Cache:**
   ```bash
   expo prebuild --clean
   npm cache clean --force  // or yarn cache clean
   ```
3. **Verify npm/yarn Configuration:** Make sure your npm or yarn configurations are correct and that you are using a suitable registry.
4. **Try Different Package Manager:** If using npm, try yarn and vice-versa.
5. **Update Node.js and npm/yarn:**  Ensure you're using the latest versions.
6. **Check Proxy Settings:** If behind a proxy, configure the `https-proxy` environment variable correctly.
7. **Run as Administrator/root:** Sometimes, permission issues can prevent installations.
